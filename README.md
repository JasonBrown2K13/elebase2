## Known bugs

On the Day-To-Day page in mobile view, sometimes the fixed navigation at the top can go off-screen temporary due to the page being able to be scrolled left as a result of some images on the page being too large.

When the prototype is viewed in landscape mode on a mobile device, the hamburger menu is too big and cannot be displayed fully on the device's display. 

When used on a Safari running on an iPad, sometimes the cross button to close the hamburger menu remains present even after the hamburger menu has been closed.

The page does not display correctly in any version of Internet Explorer due to the way that Siemma (a crtitical component of the Elebase framework) is rendered.
